\[The theme i have chosen for my dataset is the genre of post-rock. I decided this to be my theme as I am interested in the genre and other adjacent genres and can find arrangements and scores for songs that I listen to that I can encorporate into my portfolio. I will aim to encorporate bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Swans, and Mogwai, among others that I deem fitting when working on my folio.
